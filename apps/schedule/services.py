Personalised timetable service.

Algorithm:
  1. Get the student's registered units for the current term (StudentUnit table)
  2. Get the current academic term
  3. Query TimetableSlot WHERE unit IN student_units AND term = current_term
  4. Deduplicate identical slots caused by multiple timetable uploads
  5. Group slots by day, sort by start_time
  6. Detect and flag legitimate time conflicts
  7. Return structured payload
