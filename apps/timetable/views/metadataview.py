    Drives the student "Timetable Stream Setup" dropdowns.

    Programs are matched per-upload-batch and can end up duplicated in the
    DB under the same display name (see apps.programs.utils for why) — a
    3rd/4th-year student and a 1st/2nd-year student can end up looking at
    what is really one program split across two different Program rows.
    So courses here are grouped by their *display name* rather than raw
    Program id: each entry in "courses" can map to several underlying
    Program ids, and "years"/"groups" are the union across all of them —
    a program that is genuinely only offered in, say, years 1-2 still
    only ever shows years [1, 2], because that union is still built
    purely from whatever TimetableSlot rows actually exist.
